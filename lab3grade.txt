1. -5: (really -1 for each problem - write out the name of the rule for each step)

2. good

3. -2: (1) + (a*c) + c - with the 1 there, it's always true

4. -5: this works out to a + b

5. -3: (a'*a) is 0, not 1

6. -5: Should have majority output instead of all 0's as MUX input

7. -5: should have constant values as inputs and variables as selectors

8. -2: other way around - there are 6 states so you need 3 state bits, and 3 possible inputs, so you need 2 input bits

9. -10

10. -10
