avg: you can't store a non-zero value in r0 -2
the ADD instruction uses 3 registers, not a register and immediate -3
if you could change the value of r0, STOR r0 wouldn't store the average in the correct location. -3
this program finds the average of the array [3 4 7 2 4]. Technically this fulfills the spec. It would be more useful if the program could find the average of an arbitrary array, though.

min: the ADD instruction uses 3 registers, not a register and immediate -3
you should use LOAD instructions initially to get the values to compare -3
If I understand your code correctly, your comments are misleading.
missing line numbers in jump instructions -6
missing final STOR -3

some of your machine code lines only have 3 digits -2
